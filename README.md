# Modern C++ By Example
We try to introduce C++ by not-so-simple, exciting but educational examples.

Soon after the basic structure is in place, contributions are welcome!

## Requirements
* A C++20 compiler
* CMake build system
* Boost libraries

Note that the minimum requirements are unknown. While our target compiler is
a C++20 compiler, most or all of the samples might be compatible with C++17 or
even older compilers. Also, we expect a recent version of CMake, but older
versions might work fine too.

All examples are tested to work with following on Fedora 36:
* GCC 12.2.1
* CMake 3.22
* Boost 1.76

However, I'll try to keep all sources compatible with what is provided in
Ubuntu 22.04 too (but I don't actively test them with it).

You should be able to compile examples on other OSes too.
